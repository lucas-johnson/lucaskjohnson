My research is focused on producing\n          carbon-equivalent estimates of radiative feedbacks (warming\n          effects) associated with the albedo change that results from\n          forest growth, reforestation, and afforestation. Additionally,\n          I’m assisting the operationalization of carbon reporting tools\n          based on data from NASA’s GEDI mission. During my PhD I\n          studied a blend of statistics, GIS, and (a bit of) forest\n          ecology, while I worked on methods for leveraging open data to\n          produce maps and estimates of forest biomass and carbon at\n          local scales relevant to management. In broad academic terms\n          I’d say this makes me a geographer, but practically speaking I\n          spend most of my time doing spatial data science.\n          \n          \n          Education\n          SUNY College of Environmental Science &\n          Forestry | Syracuse, NY\n          Ph.D. in Environmental Science | August 2019 - May 2024\n          Tufts University | Medford, MA\n          B.S. in Computer Science | August 2013 - May 2017\n          \n          \n          Experience\n          Postdoctoral Scholar | Oregon State\n          University | August 2024 - present\n          Research Assistant | SUNY ESF, CAFRI | August 2019 -\n          present\n          Data Engineer | Lightkeeper, LLC | August\n          2017 - July 2019\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Lucas Johnson\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      ResearchGate\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      CV\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I’m a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University\n              working out of the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station in\n              Riverdale, Utah.
