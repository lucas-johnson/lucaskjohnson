My work focuses\n          on methods for leveraging open data to produce maps of forest\n          structure at local scales relevant to management. I have an\n          extensive background in programming and computer science, and\n          have been learning to couple these skills with statistical\n          inference and machine learning techniques to produce\n          landscape-level insights.
