In this role,\n          I will investigate how the warming effects of surface albedo\n          change resulting from forest growth, reforestation, and\n          afforestation impact decisions around forest management for\n          climate mitigation. Additionally, I will assist in\n          operationalizing forest carbon reporting tools that leverage\n          data from NASA’s GEDI mission. During my PhD, I studied a\n          blend of statistics, GIS, and (a bit of) forest ecology. At\n          the same time, I worked on leveraging open data to produce\n          maps and estimates of forest biomass and carbon at local\n          scales relevant to management in New York State. These\n          resulting data products provided the basis for the NYS Forest\n          Carbon Assessment developed for the NYS Department of\n          Environmental Conservation. In broad academic terms, my\n          education and experience make me a geographer, but practically\n          speaking I do spatial data science with applications in\n          forested ecosystems.\n          \n          \n          Education\n          SUNY College of Environmental Science &\n          Forestry | Syracuse, NY\n          Ph.D. in Environmental Science | August 2019 - May 2024\n          Tufts University | Medford, MA\n          B.S. in Computer Science | August 2013 - May 2017\n          \n          \n          Experience\n          Postdoctoral Scholar | Oregon State\n          University | August 2024 - present\n          Research Assistant | SUNY ESF, CAFRI | August 2019 -\n          present\n          Data Engineer | Lightkeeper, LLC | August\n          2017 - July 2019\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Lucas Johnson\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      Bluesky\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      ResearchGate\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      CV\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I’m a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University\n              working with the USFS RMRS\n              Forest Inventory and Analysis unit in Riverdale, Utah.
