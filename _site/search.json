My research\n          focuses on producing carbon-equivalent estimates of radiative\n          feedbacks (warming effects) associated with the albedo change\n          that results from forest growth, reforestation, and\n          afforestation. Additionally, I’m assisting in operationalizing\n          forest carbon reporting tools that leverage data from NASA’s\n          GEDI mission. During my PhD, I studied a blend of statistics,\n          GIS, and (a bit of) forest ecology. At the same time, I worked\n          on leveraging open data to produce maps and estimates of\n          forest biomass and carbon at local scales relevant to\n          management in New York State. These resulting data products\n          provided the basis for the NYS Forest Carbon Assessment\n          developed for the NYS Department of Environmental\n          Conservation. In broad academic terms, my education and\n          experience make me a geographer, but practically speaking I do\n          spatial data science with applications in forested\n          ecosystems.\n          \n          \n          Education\n          SUNY College of Environmental Science &\n          Forestry | Syracuse, NY\n          Ph.D. in Environmental Science | August 2019 - May 2024\n          Tufts University | Medford, MA\n          B.S. in Computer Science | August 2013 - May 2017\n          \n          \n          Experience\n          Postdoctoral Scholar | Oregon State\n          University | August 2024 - present\n          Research Assistant | SUNY ESF, CAFRI | August 2019 -\n          present\n          Data Engineer | Lightkeeper, LLC | August\n          2017 - July 2019\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Lucas Johnson\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      ResearchGate\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      CV\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I’m a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University\n              working with the USFS RMRS\n              Forest Inventory and Analysis unit in Riverdale, Utah.
