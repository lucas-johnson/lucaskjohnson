In broad\n          academic terms I’d say this makes me a geographer, but\n          practically speaking I’d say I spend most of my time doing\n          spatial data science. My dissertation focused on methods for\n          leveraging open data to produce maps and estimates of forest\n          biomass and carbon at local scales relevant to management,\n          with an additional emphasis on propagating uncertainty up from\n          field measurements through modeling pipelines to eventual\n          pixel predictions and area-level estimates. I have an\n          extensive background in programming and computer science, and\n          have learned to couple these skills with statistical inference\n          and machine learning techniques to produce landscape-level\n          insights. I enjoy the challenges that come with wrangling all\n          kinds of spatial data using R and python.\n          \n          \n          Education\n          SUNY College of Environmental Science &\n          Forestry | Syracuse, NY\n          Ph.D. in Environmental Science | August 2019 - May 2024\n          Tufts University | Medford, MA\n          B.S. in Computer Science | August 2013 - May 2017\n          \n          \n          Experience\n          Research Assistant | SUNY ESF, CAFRI | August 2019 -\n          present\n          Data Engineer | Lightkeeper, LLC | August\n          2017 - July 2019\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Lucas Johnson\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      ResearchGate\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      CV\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I just finished my PhD at SUNY ESF where I studied a\n              blend of statistics, GIS, and (a bit of) forest ecology.\n              In broad academic terms I’d say this makes me a\n              geographer, but practically speaking I’d say I spend most\n              of my time doing spatial data science.
