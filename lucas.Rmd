## Bio

I'm a Ph.D. student at SUNY ESF studying carbon mapping and monitoring under
Dr. Colin Beier. 
My work focuses on methods for leveraging open data to produce maps of forest
structure at local scales relevant to management. 
I have a strong background in programming and computer science, and have been 
learning to couple these skills with statistical modeling and machine learning
techniques to produce landscape-level insights. 
I enjoy the challenges that come with wrangling all kinds of spatial data using
R, and python.
