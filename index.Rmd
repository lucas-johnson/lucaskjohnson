## Bio

I'm a Ph.D. student at SUNY ESF studying forest carbon mapping and monitoring 
under Dr. Colin Beier. 
My work focuses on methods for leveraging open data to produce maps of forest
structure at local scales relevant to management. 
I have an extensive background in programming and computer science, and have 
been learning to couple these skills with statistical inference and machine 
learning techniques to produce landscape-level insights. 
I enjoy the challenges that come with wrangling all kinds of spatial data using
R and python.
