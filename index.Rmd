## Bio

I’m a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University working out of the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station in Riverdale, Utah. My research focuses on producing carbon-equivalent estimates of radiative feedbacks (warming effects) associated with the albedo change that results from forest growth, reforestation, and afforestation. Additionally, I’m assisting in operationalizing forest carbon reporting tools that leverage data from NASA’s GEDI mission. During my PhD, I studied a blend of statistics, GIS, and (a bit of) forest ecology. At the same time, I worked on leveraging open data to produce maps and estimates of forest biomass and carbon at local scales relevant to management in New York State. These resulting data products provided the basis for the NYS Forest Carbon Assessment developed for the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation. In broad academic terms, my education and experience make me a geographer, but practically speaking I do spatial data science with applications in forested ecosystems.
